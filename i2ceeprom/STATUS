First successful repeated start read.

Need to implement scoping on i2c structure. Can't
bring read data back out yet. Use semaphore
to wait on read routine then read data with return
function? Messy messy

Basic outlines for testing i2c with eeprom. 

Need to get serialized reads and writes working first. (see branch i2cmutex)
